Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how individuals perceive and interact with the world. It encompasses a wide range of conditions, with varying degrees of challenges in social communication, behavior, and learning abilities. Early detection of ASD can lead to better management and improved outcomes through intervention.

This project aims to provide a tool for the early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. It uses machine learning models to analyze behavioral and developmental data to predict the likelihood of ASD. The tool is designed for both children and adults, offering tailored diagnostic questions to assist clinicians in identifying signs of autism.

Features:
Interactive Interface: The system includes a user-friendly web interface to facilitate easy interaction for both clinicians and parents.
Data-driven Insights: The system leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze input data and predict the probability of ASD.
Personalized Questions: Diagnostic questions are personalized for different age groups, making the tool effective for both children and adults.
Visualized Results: The results are presented with intuitive visualizations, aiding in better understanding and decision-making.


Technologies Used:
Frontend: React, CSS, HTML
Backend: Flask, Python
Machine Learning Models: Scikit-learn, joblib
Database: MySQL (for storing historical data)
This project aims to contribute to the early identification and intervention for individuals with ASD, providing a valuable tool for parents, clinicians, and educators to ensure timely support.
